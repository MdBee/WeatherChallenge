# WeatherChallenge
This is a quick effort to satisfy the requirements of the Weather Coding Challenge exercise.
Given more time I would refactor to take advantage of Swift 4's Codable protocol and integrate it with a simpler and more up to date Core Data implementation.
My approach to caching the images is somewhat crude.  It works, but using a framework like Kingfisher might be better.  I wanted to avoid all third party dependencies (Cocoapods) for this demo.
If it was desired and I had time to add detail to the comments I would use AppleScript syntax.
